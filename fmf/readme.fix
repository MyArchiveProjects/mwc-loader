# ⚠️ Before You Start

Please read this:

✔ Game must NOT be running
✔ Steam doesn’t need to be closed, but better if it is
✔ You need enough free disk space for backup
✔ Antivirus may complain — add the folder to exceptions if needed

---

# 🛠 Installation

1️⃣ Download the tool
2️⃣ Extract it anywhere (NOT into Program Files if possible)
3️⃣ Run using Python 3.10+
4️⃣ If Windows Defender cries — ignore it, the app just edits game files

---

# 🧭 Interface Overview

### 🔍 Auto Detect Game

The tool automatically searches your drives and tries to find your **My Winter Car** installation.
If found — it asks you to confirm.

---

### 📂 Browse Folder

Manual selection.
Choose your game folder where you see files like:

```
mywintercar.exe
mywintercar_Data
```

(or already renamed versions)

---

### 🧯 Apply FIX (Main Button)

This is the most important function.

When you click it:
✔ Creates a FULL backup of the game
✔ Renames files:

```
mywintercar.exe  →  mysummercar.exe
mywintercar_Data →  mysummercar_Data
```

✔ Creates a desktop shortcut
✔ Copies everything from `fmf/` into the game folder (if any files exist)

After this step your Winter Car becomes compatible with MSC Loader.

---

### 🔙 Revert

Changes your game back to Winter Car mode.
It renames files back:

```
mysummercar.exe  →  mywintercar.exe
mysummercar_Data →  mywintercar_Data
```

Useful if something goes wrong.

---

### 🚀 Install Loader

Installs **MSC Loader 1.3.4** automatically.
This is the recommended, stable and tested version.

If you want another Loader version:

* You CAN install another one manually
* However, **no guarantees it will work**
* Old versions sometimes break
* New versions sometimes behave unpredictable

That’s why default recommended flow:
👉 Apply FIX
👉 Install built-in Loader
👉 Enjoy

---

### 📁 FMF Folder

There is a folder in the tool directory called:

```
fmf/
```

Anything you put inside it will be copied into your game folder AFTER a successful fix.

Useful for:
✔ Mods
✔ DLL libraries
✔ Config files
✔ Additional patches

Folder structure is preserved.

---

# 🧷 Backups

Before any modification, the tool automatically creates a backup in:

```
Backups/
```

Backups are timestamped.
If anything breaks — simply restore your backup.

---

# 🧠 Logs

Everything the program does is recorded into:

```
logs/
```

If something fails — the reason will be there.

---

# ❌ Possible Problems & Solutions

### Game doesn’t launch after FIX

Likely causes:

* Broken mods
* Wrong Loader version
* Game update changed something

Solution:
✔ Revert
✔ Verify game files in Steam
✔ Run FIX again

---

### Loader doesn’t detect game

Happens if:

* You installed a custom Loader
* Loader version is incompatible
* Folder structure isn’t correct

Solution:
✔ Use built-in Loader 1.3.4
✔ Try another version manually
✔ Read logs

---

### Antivirus warning

Completely normal.
This tool:
❌ does NOT steal data
❌ does NOT contain malware
❌ does NOT break Steam

It only renames files and copies mods.

# 🧨 Risks (Honest Statement)

* You are modifying your game
* My Winter Car updates may break compatibility
* Mods are always risky

That’s why:
✔ Backups are created automatically
✔ Nothing is modified without your permission
✔ You can always revert
